# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
Marketing Analytics broadly refers to the practice of using analytical methods and techniques to understand the effectiveness of various marketing activities and deploy data-driven decisions to optimize for ROI on conversion rates. It typically involves analyzing various metrics around customer engagement with various marketing activities including but not limited to, ATL (above the line) marketing activities, BTL (below the line) campaigns, targeting personalized offers. Typically the variables of interest are customer profile, campaign conversion rates, and costs associated with various marketing channels. These can generate valuable insights that can help an organization form better marketing strategies, optimize/innovate on delivery, and achieve overall growth. In this project, suppose we were given that recent the marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be and the conversion rate is very low. My task is to analyze the related data, understand the problem, and identify key insights and recommendations for the CMO to potentially implement.
